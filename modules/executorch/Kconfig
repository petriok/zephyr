config EXECUTORCH
	bool "ExecuTorch Support"
	select REQUIRES_FULL_LIBCPP
	help
	  This option enables the ExecuTorch library.

if EXECUTORCH

rsource "Kconfig.backends"

config EXECUTORCH_ENABLE_LOGGING
	bool "Enable ExecuTorch logging"
	default y
	help
	  Enable logging within the ExecuTorch runtime.

config EXECUTORCH_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACER
	bool "Enable ExecuTorch event tracer"
	default n
	help
	  Enable the event tracer for performance profiling.

config EXECUTORCH_ENABLE_PROGRAM_VERIFICATION
	bool "Enable ExecuTorch program verification"
	default n
	help
	  Enable verification of the ExecuTorch program flatbuffer.

config EXECUTORCH_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "Optimize ExecuTorch for size"
	default y
	help
	  Optimize the ExecuTorch library for size (-Os).

config EXECUTORCH_BUILD_EXECUTOR_RUNNER
	bool "Build ExecuTorch executor runner"
	default n
	help
	  Build the executor_runner utility. Note: this may require POSIX 
	  functions not available in Zephyr and is typically not needed 
	  for embedded applications.

config EXECUTORCH_BUILD_DATA_LOADER
	bool "Build ExecuTorch data loader extension"
	default n
	help
	  Build the file data loader extension. Note: this requires POSIX 
	  file I/O functions and is typically not needed for embedded 
	  applications that load models from memory.

config EXECUTORCH_BUILD_PORTABLE_OPS
	bool "Build ExecuTorch portable operators library"
	default y
	help
	  Build the default portable operators library that includes all 
	  available operators. When disabled, you should use selective 
	  operator building to include only needed operators, but the 
	  underlying kernel implementations will still be available.

config EXECUTORCH_METHOD_ALLOCATOR_POOL_SIZE
	int "Method allocator pool size in bytes"
	default 16384
	help
	  Size of the method allocator pool in bytes. This memory is used
	  for allocating ExecuTorch method instances and their metadata.
	  Default is 16KB which should be sufficient for most small models.
	  Larger models may require more memory.

config EXECUTORCH_TEMP_ALLOCATOR_POOL_SIZE
	int "Temporary allocator pool size in bytes"
	default 2048
	help
	  Size of the temporary allocator pool in bytes. This memory is used
	  for temporary allocations during model execution such as intermediate
	  tensor calculations. Default is 2KB which should be sufficient for
	  simple operations. Complex models may require more memory.

config EXECUTORCH_MODEL_NAME
	string "Model filename for header generation"
	default "model_add.pte"
	help
	  Filename of the pre-generated .pte model file located in the example_files
	  directory. This file will be used to generate gen_ops_def.yml and the
	  corresponding model header file. The model must be generated manually
	  outside the Zephyr build process.
